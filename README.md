# sponsor2.0

Name: Ashleigh Godkin
Student No: 20071063

This is a NodeJS app developed in Webstorm where users can choose an animal to sponsor. It incorporates GET requests (findAll, findOne),
POST requests to add a new donation, and DELETE requests to remove a donation.
I could not get the PUT request working to increase the amount a user has donated.

I have this project connected to my GitHub account, and also to mLab.
